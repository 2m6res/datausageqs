# DataUsageQS
### "Data Usage Quick Settings"
A simple Flutter app, with a Kotlin backend, made to display this month's mobile data usage in Quick Settings.

## Why?
I didn't have easy access to my mobile data usage information on my phone, so I made it myself while learning a little bit of Kotlin and Flutter.

# Features
- Support for:
  - English
  - Slovak
- This month's data usage QS tile (customization options coming soon)

# Download
Grab the latest release from the Github releases page, and install it.
